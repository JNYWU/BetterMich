# BetterMich
An App that shows Taiwan Michelin restaurants information.

## Features
- See restaurant distinction, city, and type at a glance
- Sort or reverse sort by Distinction
- Multiple-select filter for distinction and city
- Instant search for restaurant name, city, or type
- One tap to call or navigate to the restaurant (phone call will not work on simulator, please run on actual device to test the feature)

## Future Plans
- Seperate Sustainable from distinction filter options, it should be independent
- Integrate CoreData or the new SwiftData framework
- Save filter options to CoreData or plist, so it will not be reset every time
- Add visited, like or dislike label to restaurant
- Show restaurant photo
- When tap on list cell, navigate to a detailed view that shows more detailed information like address and description
